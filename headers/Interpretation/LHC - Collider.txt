Lyrics of the song "Collider"
    by LHC (Les Horribles Cernettes)

    Their Youtube channel reads:
    "The one and only High Energy band. Formed in
    1990, at the same time, and in the office
    next door to the World Wide Web"

    Notable for being the first image
    uploaded to the World Wide Web

    If you enjoy hurting yourself,
    you can replace "collider" with any unstressed
    three syllable word that relates to your
    profession. For example, "compiler"


Dip, dah, ooh, yeah
Dip, dah, ooh, yeah
Dip, dah, ooh, yeah
Dip, dah, ooh, yeah

You say you love me but you never beep me
You always promise but you never date me
I try to fax but it's busy, always
I try the network but you crash the gateways

You never spend your nights with me
And you don't go out with other girls either
You only love your collider

I fill you screen with hearts and roses
I fill your mail file with lovely phrases
They all come back: "invalid user"
You never let me into your computer

You never spend your nights with me
And you don't go out with other girls either
You prefer your collider

I gave you golden ring to show you my love
You went to stick it in a printed circuit
To fix a voltage leak in your collector
You plug my feelings into your detector

You never spend your nights with me
And you don't go out with other girls either
You only love your collider
Your collider
Your collider
